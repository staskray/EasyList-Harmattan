easylist (0.0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now when hovering over a list item or list will cause a grey highlight.
  * Fixed a major bug with list items which didn't fit in the view. Those items didn't work.
  * Selecting a list from the Lists page now brings you back to the List page.
  * Colors now stored in ezConsts.js. First step towards theme support.
  * Current list name now shown in List page header.
  * Orientation setting is now a button row instead of switches.
